## Introduction:

**Projects Aim:** I'm currently learning to code in JavaScript on Codecademy and trying to become a fullstack dev. 
This is the first Codecademy project prompt I've made outside of the Codecademy site.

The main goal of this project was to create a randomly generated message that has three parts to it.
I decide to create a silly, non-sensical pick up line generator. The lines have an intro, body, and ending.
The code cycles through these three parts randomly to generate a pick up line for the user.


### Technologies
This project is created with:
  * JavaScript
  * VSCode
## To-do List:
While I've finished the criteria for the Codecademy project, I intend to return later on to add HTML and CSS
to make a complete page with functionality, such as a generate button.
